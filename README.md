Introduction 

Skin diseases are a major health concern and accurate diagnosis is critical for effective treatment. An estimated 3.6 billion people worldwide suffering from some form of skin disorder. Classifying skin diseases accurately and quickly is important for timely diagnosis and treatment. A deep learning system that can accurately classify skin diseases could have a significant impact on healthcare. The skin is visible and accessible, making it an ideal candidate for non-invasive diagnostic techniques. A deep learning system for skin disease classification could be implemented as a point-of-care tool, potentially reducing the need for costly and time-consuming diagnostic procedures. Working on a deep learning project in skin disease classification can be a rewarding and impactful way to apply your skills and knowledge to a real-world problem. It has the potential to make a positive difference in the lives of many people.  Molluscum contagiosum is a viral infection that causes small, flesh colored, or pink bumps on the skin. It is caused by the molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV). The bumps, which are also called Mollusca, are usually painless and can appear anywhere on the body, although they are mostly found on the face, neck, armpits, and genitals. Molluscum contagiosum is most common in children and young adults. The bumps usually resolve on their own within a few months to a year, but treatment may be recommended to speed up recovery or if the bumps are causing discomfort or embarrassment. Eczema, also known as atopic dermatitis, is a chronic skin condition that causes inflammation, redness, and itching. It is most common in children but can also affect adults. The exact cause of eczema is not known, but it is thought to be related to an overactive immune system and an inability to properly protect the skin from irritants and allergens. Eczema can appear anywhere on the body, but is most commonly found on the face, elbows, knees, and ankles. The symptoms of eczema can range from mild to severe, and may include dry, itchy skin, redness, swelling, and crusting or scaling of the skin. In severe cases, the skin may crack and bleed. There is no cure for eczema, but the condition can be managed with a combination of lifestyle changes and medications. Treatment may include the use of moisturizers, topical corticosteroids, and other medications to reduce inflammation and relieve symptoms.

Objective 

Considering the problem stated herein before in skin disease patients, we intend to design, develop and apply the customized architecture in deep learning to classify the skin disease from image data. Customized Architecture We have designed and implemented customized architecture for the classification from image data. There are certain layers in our architecture. The layers were used in the following sequence: There are 3 convolutional layers with ‘Relu as an activation function’ followed by a consecutive max-pooling layer in 3 different sets. Then there is a flatten layer followed by a fully connected layer with ‘Relu’ as an activation function followed by a soft-max layer. Note: At this juncture, please note that we have tried finding the labelled data set of PET Scan images, since it was not available, so we took up another challenging problem i.e. to make the customized deep learning architecture to classify the skin diseases from image dataset.
